## Intro to Web Proxies 

most web apps are continuously connecting to back-end servers to send and receive data  
testing and securing back-end servers is becoming more and more important 

testing back-end servers make up the bulk of web app pen testing   
to capture the requests and traffic passing between apps and back-end servers, and then manipulate them, we need to use web proxies 

**web proxies** are tools that can be setup between a browser/mobile app and a back-end server to capture and view all requests being made between them   
essentially a MITM tool   
packet sniffers like wiresharks work by analyzing all local traffic, where web proxies work with web ports like 80 and 443

they are essential tools for intercepting requests and modifying them to see how the back-end server handles them 

there are other uses than just HTTP requests: 
- web app vulnerability scanning 
- web fuzzing 
- web crawling 
- web app mapping 
- web request analysis 
- web configuration testing 
- code review 

### Burp suite

most common web proxy for web pen testing  
various features and built in chromium browser to test web apps  

paid only features: 
- active web app scanner
- fast burp intruder 
- ability to load certain burp extensions 

free version good enough for most pen testers  

### OWASP zed attack proxy (ZAP)

another common web proxy tool   
open-source and no paid only   
continually gaining many of the paid-only features that burp has
