# Broken Authentication

## What is Authentication

authentication is the act of proving an assertion  
in this module which is more app security focused, authentication could be described as determining if an entity is who it claims to be 

most widespread form of authentication used in web apps is a login form   
usually the first line of defense against unauthorized access 

keep in mind this is not authorization which is the process of approving or disapproving a request from a given, authenticated, entity   

most companies offer certain services for which their customers have to register and authenticate  
our goal is to verify if these login forms are implemented securely and if we can bypass them to gain unauthorized access
