# Broken Authentication

## What is Authentication

authentication is the act of proving an assertion  
in this module which is more app security focused, authentication could be described as determining if an entity is who it claims to be 

most widespread form of authentication used in web apps is a login form   
usually the first line of defense against unauthorized access 

keep in mind this is not authorization which is the process of approving or disapproving a request from a given, authenticated, entity   

most companies offer certain services for which their customers have to register and authenticate  
our goal is to verify if these login forms are implemented securely and if we can bypass them to gain unauthorized access   

## Overview of Authentication Methods 

during the authentication phase the entity who wants to auth sends an `identification string` which could be an ID, username, email, etc.   
the most common type of data that an auth process requires to be sent with the identification string is a password   
however, the type of additional data can vary in type 

### Multi-factor authentication 

MFA or 2FA can result in a much more robust authentication process   

3 domains of factors: 
- something you know 
- something you have 
- something you are 

### Form-based authentication 

most common authentication methods for web apps is form-based authentication   
app presents an HTML form where user inputs username and password; access granted after comparing the received data against a backend 

after successful login the app server creates a session tied to a unique key (usually stored in a cookie)   
key is passed between the client and the web app on every subsequent communication for the session to be maintained 

some require multiple steps of authentication like also using a one-time password OTP   
these can originate from a hardware device or app   
usually only last for a limited amount of time and are valid for only one login attempt   

some multi-step procedures suffer from `business logic` vulnerabilities like step 3 might take for granted that step 1 and 2 have been completed successfully 

### HTTP based authentication 

app server can specify different auth schemes such as basic, digest, and NTLM   
all schemes revolve around the `401` status code and the `WWW-Authenticate` response header   
used by app servers to challenge a client request and provide authentication details (challenge-response process)

when using http-based auth the `authorization header` also holds the authentication data and should be present in every request for the user to be authenticated 

from a network pov this can be less secure that FBA because every request contains authentication data   
for example, the browser encodes the username and password using base64; the authorization header will contain the base64 encoded credentials in every request  
therefore, an attacker that can capture the traffic in plaintext will also capture credentials   
the same would happen in FBA but just not for every request 

an example header that a browser sends for basic authentication would look like: 

```shell-session
GET /basic_auth.php HTTP/1.1
Host: brokenauth.hackthebox.eu
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46czNjdXIzcDQ1NQ==
```

it specifies the authentication method, like Basic, and the token which can be decoded to `admin:s3cur3p455`

digest and NTLM are more robust because they use hashed data and could contain a nonce, but these can still be cracked and might also be vulnerable to reusing a captured token 

### Other forms of authentication

uncommon but also possible that authentication is performed by checking the source IP address  
a request from localhost or trusted IP could be allowed because developers assumed nobody would use them 

modern apps can also use third parties to authenticate users like `SAML` and APIs usually require a authentication form which are often multi-step 

attacks against API authentication/authorization, SSO, and OAuth have the same foundations as attacks against classic web apps 

### Login example 

a typical scenario for home banking authentication: 
- requests our ID which could be seven-digit number generated by app or a username 
- app requests a password for the given ID 
- user must provide an OTP 
- app checks if the ID, password, and OTP are valid
