# Hacking Wordpress

## Intro 

wordpress is the most popular open source CMS and powers nealry one-third of all websites in the world   
can be used for things like hosting blogs, forums, e-commerce, project management, document management and much more   
customizability and extensible nature make it prone to vulnerabilities through third-party themes and plugins   
written in PHP and usually runs on Apache with MySQL as backend 

### What is a CMS 

a CMS is a powerful tool that helps build a website without needing to code everything from scratch   
can edit sites as if working in a word processor and users can upload media directly from a media library interface instead of interacting with the webserver either through a management portal or via FTP or SFTP   

a CMS is made up of two key components
- a content management application (CMA) = interface used to add and manage content 
- content delivery application (CDA) = backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working site
