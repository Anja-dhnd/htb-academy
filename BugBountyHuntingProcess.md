# Bug Bounty Hunting Process

## Bug Bounty Programs 

bug bounty programs can be seen as crowdsourcing initiatives that people can get recognition and compensation for discovering and reporting software bugs   
but they are more than that as they are continuous and proactive security testing that supplements internal code audits and penetration tests, and completes and orgs vulnerability management strategy   
hackerone describes their platform as continuous testing and constant protection 

### Bug bounty program types 

programs can be private or public 

private bug bounty programs are only open by invitation  
most programs start out as private until the company gets used to receiving and triaging vulnerability reports    
hackers will get invitations based on their track record, valid finding consistency, and violation record 

public programs are open to the entire hacking community 

parent/child programs also exist where a bounty pool and a single cyber security team are shared between a parent company and its subsidiaries   
if a subsidiary launches a bug bounty program (child) then this will be linked to the parent program 

bug bounty program (BBP) and vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) are not the same  
a VDP only provides guidance on how an org prefers receiving information on identified vulnerabilities by third parties   
a BBP incentivizes third parties to find bugs to then get monetary rewards 

### Bug bounty program code of conduct 

need to spend a lot of time reading the code of conduct that is for expectations of behavior and to make hunters more effective

### Bug bounty program structure

the policy section lets orgs publish info about their program to communicate specifics about the program to hackers   
orgs typically publish a vulnerability disclosure policy with guidance on how they want to get info related to potential vulnerabilities   
this policy also includes the scope which is what hackers can test and send reports for   

a bug bounty program usually has these elements: 
- `vendor response SLAs` - define when and how the vendor will reply
- `access` - how to create or obtain accounts for research purposes 
- `eligibility criteria` - eligible for compensation; ex: be the first to report a vulnerability 
- `response disclosure policy` - defines disclosure timelines, coordination actions to safely disclose a vulnerability, increase user safety, etc. 
- `rules of engagement` 
- `scope` - in-scope IP ranges, domains, vulnerabilities, etc. 
- `out of scope`
- `reporting format`
- `rewards` 
- `safe harbor` 
- `legal terms and conditions` 
- `contact info`
